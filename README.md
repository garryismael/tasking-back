# BACKEND FOR TASK APPLICATION

To run the application, execute the command ```docker run -d``` if you use Docker
or ```./mvnw spring-boot:run``` if you use java(version21).

But before, you should create a file named application.yml in resources folder and copy the file from example.yml and change your content.
